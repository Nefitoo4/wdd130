    <p>Hello everyone! My Name is Nefi Zaldana but some calls me Nessi, I am 31 years old, I am from El Salvador, is a little country in Central America. I am single but I'm datting with a beautiful woman, and we would like some day to get sealed for this life and the eternity in our local Temple, the house of the Lord. One on my favorite hobbies is to learn languages, I am poliglot and I speak many languages, also I like work with stop motion (animation) and visit turist places.</p>
    <P>I am taking Applied Technology oriented to programming and website design to work to front-end support some day, I currently work in a company as an Analyst Workforce and I have to work with a few spreadsheets applications. I hope some day to get other promotion in the company to work with the IT department or get a better job in other place, I have the vision to become a big entrepreneur and develop some amazing applications for human benefit.</P>
